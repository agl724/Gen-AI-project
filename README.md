# Gen-AI-project
For IBM Gen AI course by Pari Agrawal 
This project is an interactive AI-based tool that generates personalized marketing content using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT models via a Streamlit web interface. The app adapts its responses based on the user's input and chosen persona — Kid, Adult, or Senior Citizen — along with specific marketing goals.

Some features are:
LLM-powered Generation: Uses gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct through LangChain's interface.
Dynamic prompt generation with relevant examples using LangChain's FewShotPromptTemplate and LengthBasedExampleSelector.
User Interface: Built with Streamlit for a smooth, browser-based UX.
